# IMDB in Keras
Practise project for Deep Learning with Keras.

## Dataset:
IMDB dataset from keras library is used here. This project uses a dataset of 25,000 IMDB reviews. Each review, comes with a label. A label of 0 is given to a negative review, and a label of 1 is given to a positive review. One can see more information about this dataset in the [Keras](https://keras.io/datasets/) website.

## Goal:
TThe goal of this lab is to create a model that will predict the sentiment of a review, based on the words on it. You can see more information about this dataset in the Keras website.
